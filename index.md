## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6 part 2 
I thought this lab was interesting for me because I got to make a code for the game blackjack. I had to use if and if-else statements to help determine the score and whether the score is greater or less than 21. For me, the most challenging part of this lab was being able to determine the correct format in putting in the if statement for the card_name values but once I was able to determine the format for it, I was able to figure out the rest of the other if-statements so that I am able to correctly return the total score when the program is run. 

Lab 7 
I thought that this was another fun lab to do because it help taught me how to write code for parking rules and using functions to implement the parking restrictions on some signs. I had to use functions like if-statements to validate the days, hours, and minutes of the restrictions on each parking sign. For me, the most challenging part of this lab was writing an if-statement for validating the day since I had to validate each day and then print out an error statement if it was an invalid day.  

Lab 8 part 2 
This was my favorite lab because in part 2 of this lab we got to write code so that we could create patterns using loop statements. In part 2 of this lab we had to use loop statements like for-loops so when the program was run it used bars ( | ) and dash ( - ) characters to help create patterns. For me, the most challenging part of this lab was being able to figure out the for-loops to use to print out the bars and dashes in the correct order.
